  utter_astigmatism_define:
  - text: '{name}: Astigmatism is a condition where the cornea has an abnormal curvature,
      causing a distortion in vision. A normal cornea is round but in astigmatism
      the cornea is oval-shaped, causing problems in focusing the light entering the
      eye. Astigmatism is a very common condition and often occurs together with myopia
      (short-sightedness) or hyperopia (long-sightedness).'
  utter_astigmatism_symptoms:
  - text: Symptoms and signs of astigmatism include blurring of vision at all distances,
      headache, eye strain and squinting. You may also have difficulty driving at
      night.
  utter_glaucoma_appointment:
  - text: You should reschedule your appointment as soon as you can. Please check
      if you have enough medications, if not, kindly call ____ to obtain more.
  utter_glaucoma_define:
  - text: '{name}: Glaucoma is a group of diseases with characteristic optic nerve
      damage, resulting in irreversible loss of vision. Most, but not all of these
      diseases are characterised by raised pressure in the eye (intraocular pressure).
      The level of pressure that causes damage can vary in different individuals and
      the resistance level of the optic nerve. Glaucoma is known as the silent thief
      of sight as the initial vision loss is mainly peripheral and not readily noticeable.
      Central vision and reading vision are usually spared until later.'
  utter_glaucoma_diagnosed:
  - text: Glaucoma is diagnosed by measuring intraocular pressure of the eye and assessing
      the optic nerve at the back of the eye for any damage. A visual field test is
      usually performed and other tests can be added to further assess the optic nerve
      and the state of the drainage system for fluid in the eye. The visual field
      test assesses the function of the optic nerve by checking if you can see spots
      of light of different intensities at different locations inside a visual field
      machine. It helps the ophthalmologist determine if your disease is worsening
      or stable.
  utter_glaucoma_eyedrop_treatment:
  - text: Glaucoma eyedrops work by lowering the intraocular pressure to a level that
      is safe for the eye. Your ophthalmologist will be able to advise on individualised
      treatment options. Even after successful control of the pressure, regular monitoring
      is still required. Glaucoma eyedrops should be taken regularly according to
      your doctorâ€™s prescription. Even after successful control of the pressure
      with eyedrops, regular monitoring is still required. It is not advisable for
      you to stop your eyedrops without consulting your doctor.
  utter_glaucoma_eyedrop_stoprisk:
  - text: It is not advisable for you to stop your glaucoma eyedrops without consulting
      your ophthalmologist. Please get your prescription re-printed.
  utter_glaucoma_lasertreat_followup:
  - text: It is important for you to follow your doctor's instructions after laser
      treatment. You should use the eyedrops you are given and turn up for your follow
      up appointment.
  utter_glaucoma_lasers_treatment:
  - text: 'Your doctor might offer laser as a treatment option depending the type
      of glaucoma that you have. Laser procedures might include: Laser peripheral
      iridotomy Laser trabeculoplasty Laser/ micropulse laser trans-scleral cyclophotocoagulation
      (TCP/ MPTCP) Your ophthalmologist will advise you on individualised treatment
      options, where necessary.'
  utter_glaucoma_postopt_eyecare:
  - text: 'Eyedrops have been instilled to dilate (enlarge) or constrict (shrink)
      your pupils for the laser treatment. Your vision might be blurred for the next
      1 to 2 days. You may feel more comfortable using sunglasses if you experience
      any glare. You should avoid driving after your laser treatment and have someone
      to accompany you home. You can take mild painkiller (e.g. Panadol) should you
      experience pain or headaches. Should you require an urgent review after your
      laser procedure, please call the following numbers: - During office hours at
      6227 7266 - After office hours at 6532 4865 For urgent consultation after office
      hours, Sundays and Public Holidays, please proceed to Singapore General Hospital
      Accident and Emergency Department located at Block 1.'
  utter_glaucoma_riskfactors:
  - text: 'Risk factors for glaucoma include: Age - your risk increases when you are
      over 80 years old Chronic diseases - you are at increased risk if you have diabetes
      or high blood pressure Ethnicity - Asians are more susceptible to angle-closure
      glaucoma than Caucasians Eye injuries Family history Use of corticosteroid Inherently
      high pressure inside the eye Refractive error (short-sightedness or myopia is
      a risk factor for open-angle glaucoma; long-sightedness or hyperopia is a risk
      factor for closed-angle glaucoma)'
  utter_glaucoma_surgical_treatment:
  - text: 'In some cases, surgery is recommended. This could be due to the type of
      glaucoma, or when medications and/or laser treatment fail to control the condition.
      In general, surgery provides an alternative route for the fluids inside the
      eye to drain out, thereby lowering the intraocular pressure to a safe level.
      Examples of possible surgeries include: Trabeculectomy Tube shunt surgery Minimally
      invasive glaucoma surgery Your ophthalmologist will advise you on individualised
      treatment options, where necessary.'
  utter_glaucoma_symptoms:
  - text: There are a few types of glaucoma and each type has slightly different symptoms.
      Open-angle glaucoma Open-angle glaucoma accounts for the majority of glaucoma
      in most countries. It often has no symptoms and progresses slowly. The rise
      in intraocular pressure is slow and painless. Closed-angle glaucoma Angle-closure
      glaucoma can either be acute or chronic. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is characterised
      by a sudden, dramatic increase in intraocular pressure. This can cause severe
      eye pain, redness, blurred vision and the appearance of haloes around lights.
      Headaches, nausea and vomiting may follow. This emergency requires prompt treatment.
      The chronic form may show no symptoms, as in open-angle glaucoma Congenital
      glaucoma Congenital glaucoma is rare and occurs at birth. Enlargement of the
      infant's eyes, corneal haze, tearing and unusual light sensitivity are symptoms
      that warrant an eye examination. Secondary glaucoma Secondary glaucoma may be
      caused by conditions such as poorly controlled diabetes, inflammation of the
      eye, tumours, previous eye surgery, injuries or cataracts in their advanced
      stages, or the use of steroid medications on the eye.
  utter_glaucoma_treated:
  - text: 'Glaucoma cannot be cured, but in most cases, it can be successfully controlled.
      Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma you are diagnosed with. Treatment
      modalities include: Eye drops Oral medications Laser surgery Filtering surgery
      Drainage implants All these treatments lower the intraocular pressure to a level
      that is safe for the eye. Your ophthalmologist will be able to advise on individualised
      treatment options. Even after successful control of the pressure, regular monitoring
      is still required. Glaucoma is a chronic condition requiring lifelong review.
      The aim of treatment is to preserve the remaining vision. Damage from glaucoma
      cannot be reversed, hence the importance of early diagnosis.'
  utter_glaucoma_visualfield_test:
  - text: visual field loss can also help your doctor determine your condition. Visual
      field can be tested by your doctor or using machines (formal perimetry). Formal
      perimetry can be automated or manual. Confrontation visual field exam. This
      is a quick and basic check of the visual field. Your doctor will sit directly
      in front of you. One of your eyes will be covered while your other eye will
      be focused at the doctor’s eyes at all time. You will be asked if you can see
      the doctor’s hand (either counting the number of fingers displayed or if the
      whole hand is moving) which is at your peripheral vision. Automated perimetry.
      You will be seated in front of a machine with a bowl shaped screen in a dark
      room. One eye will be tested at each time. You will be asked to focus at a target
      in the middle of the screen at all times during the test. Small flashes of light
      of different intensities will come on at different points at your peripheral
      vision. You will have to press a button when you see the light. You may blink
      normally during the test. Manual perimetry. You will be seated in front of a

The tear film is an essential part for ensuring the overall health of the ocular surface. It cleanses, lubricates and nourishes the surface of the eye as well as protects it against infection. Both the quality and quantity of the tears must be maintained within certain levels to ensure a healthy and clear surface essential for good vision.
Chronic dry eye can lead to damage of the eyes surface, increased risk of eye infections, and eventually the inability to produce tears. Left untreated, severe forms of dry eye may even damage your vision."

  utter_dryeyes-causes_riskfactors-cornearefractive:
  - text: "Dry eyes are caused by a lack of adequate tears. Your tears are a complex mixture of three basic layers - oil, water and mucus. This mixture helps make the surface of your eyes smooth and clear, and helps protect your eyes from infection. Problems with any of these layers can cause dry eye syndrome.

The outer layer (oil layer) is produced by the meibomian glands that line the edge of the upper and lower eyelids. The water layer is produced by the lacrimal gland located under the orbital rim bone just below the eyebrow. The mucus layer is produced by microscopic goblet cells in the conjunctiva.
For some people, the cause of dry eyes may be due to an imbalance in the composition of their tears, or they do not produce enough tears to keep their eyes comfortably lubricated. Age, eyelid problems, certain ocular and systemic diseases and medications, and other causes such as environmental factors and hormonal changes can also lead to dry eyes.

with your ophthalmologist regarding the type of intraocular lens that works best for you.
Your intraocular lens will determine how well you can see after cataract surgery, which
can dramatically impact your quality of life.
A) Standard monofocal lens
Most commonly implanted lenses, with equal power in all regions of the lens.
 Provide good overall vision at a specific distance.
 Reading glasses will most likely be required. Monofocal lenses are suitable for people who
are comfortable wearing reading glasses.
B) Advanced Monofocal Lenses
 Aspheric lenses - Provide sharper, better quality vision than standard monofocal lenses.
 Toric lenses - Reduce astigmatism for people with high astigmatism.
Advanced monofocal lenses are suitable for people who
 Desire better quality vision.
 Do not mind wearing reading glasses for near tasks like reading or writing.
C) Multifocal Lenses
 Provide good distance and near vision without glasses.
 Highly convenient as both near and intermediate vision for fixed distances can be clearer using these lenses.
 However, some people may find it difficult to read fine print, especially in dim light and may experience glare and haloes.
 For best results, this lens should be used in both eyes.
Multifocal lenses are suitable for people who want to reduce their dependence on glasses for far and near vision. People with high astigmatism will need multifocal toric lenses which are effective in reducing astigmatism."

  utter_cataract-intraoperative-cornearefractive_148:
  - text: "Astigmatism commonly arises from the cornea or the lens. Astigmatism that arise due to the unequal curve of the cornea (think of a rugby ball instead of a soccer ball) are called regular astigmatism. If the cornea has significant scarring or degeneration, irregular astigmatism can result due to the uneven surface of the cornea.
Toric lenses used in cataract surgeries have in built astigmatic degrees which help to reduce or eliminate regular astigmatism. Broadly, there are 2 types of toric lenses that your surgeon can select for cataract surgeries
	Toric monofocal
	Toric multifocal
By reducing or eliminating the regular astigmatism, these lenses are able to help reduce your reliance on glasses. If your eye has significant irregular astigmatism due to reasons such as corneal scarring, you are unlikely to be suitable for toric lenses.
The success of toric lenses depend on accurate measurements and alignment of the lens. Side effects of toric lenses include
	The lens could still rotate soon after cataract operation and become misaligned. If the misalignment is large, you might need to undergo a second operation to re-align the lens
	Damage to the lens bag (capsular rupture) and weakening of the capsular bag support (zonulysis) can occur during rotation of the lens
	Over or under correction

The earlier a child gets myopia, the more likely he will get high myopia as an adult. Myopia tends to increase rapidly between 5 and 15 years old, and usually stabilises by the early twenties."

  utter_myopia-causes_riskfactors-cornearefractive:
  - text: "The exact cause of myopia is not known, but certain risk factors increase the likelihood of myopia, such as
 Genetic. Myopia tends to run in families.   If one of the parents is myopic, the risk of the   child developing the condition is two times   more. The risk is eight times higher if both   parents are myopic. In addition, increasing   severity of parental myopia leads to a greater   risk of myopia.
 Environmental. Lack of outdoor activities  and excessive near work like reading, playing  games on handheld electronic devices or  computers exposes one to the risk of  developing myopia.
Rarely, childhood glaucoma can lead to rapidly increasing myopia as the pressure within the eye results in the expansion of the globe."

  utter_myopia-symptoms_signs-cornearefractive:
  - text: "Other than the inconvenience of having to wear spectacles, myopia may be associated with complications such as
 Retinal tear and detachment. The eye  with high myopia is excessively elongated resulting in thinner retina. This puts the eye at greater risk of developing a retinal tear, hole or detachment. Retinal detachment  requires urgent treatment as unless the  detached retina is promptly reattached, there can be permanent loss of vision in the affected eye.
 Macular degeneration. Severe myopia of  more than 10 dioptres (1,000 degrees) may be associated with macular degeneration. The macula is the central part of the retina that gives the clearest vision. Macular degeneration causes difficulties in reading, watching TV and recognising peoples faces.
 Cataract. High myopia is associated with  earlier onset of cataract, which is opacity  or clouding of the lens that causes blurring  of vision.
 Glaucoma. Glaucoma is associated with  increased fluid pressure within the eyeball. Severe myopia increases the risk of  developing glaucoma, which if left untreated over time can cause blindness. Glaucoma is often symptomless, causing poor vision gradually and therefore is called a silent thief of sight."

  - text: "Putting on spectacles or contact lenses help to bring distant objects into focus. Depending on the degree of myopia, you may need to wear spectacles all the time or only when you need very clear distance  vision, e.g. looking at whiteboard, watching a movie, etc.
LASIK is a surgical procedure that thins the cornea (the transparent front layer of the eye). This is rather like creating a permanent contact lens on the cornea to bring distant images into focus. However, LASIK is a cosmetic and not a curative treatment, as the eye is still elongated and retains the same risk of retinal detachment, macular degeneration, etc. even after LASIK.
Once the eyeball elongates, the change is irreversible. Therefore, prevention of myopia and delaying its progression early in life are important steps in management of myopia and its consequences. "

  - text: "To ensure that your child does not become myopic, encourage him/her to adopt good eye care habits from a young age, even before he/she develops myopia. There have also been extensive studies on eye drops (e.g. atropine), spectacles and contact lens and other interventions to slow down the progression of myopia in children. Ask your doctor about the latest advances in the field.
  Encourage outdoor sports daily e.g. cycling, rollerblading, badminton, basketball, etc. Playing ball games outdoors allow your child to focus his/her eyes on a wide range of objects   that are both far and near.
 Avoid or minimise the exposure of young children to handheld devices, computer games or TV, as these activities not only increase the risk of myopia, but they can quickly become addictive, reduce attention span, learning and creativity, and may also lead to frequent tantrums.
 Switch to audio books for the avid readers. Listening and even making audio books improve listening skills, pronunciation and expression.
 Take frequent eye breaks from near work or computer screens and look out the window into the far distance every 20-30 minutes. This breaks any accommodative (focusing for near vision) spasm and helps relax the eyes.
 Read with good or natural lighting which may be protective against myopia.
 Do not lie down to read or read in moving vehicles.
 Plan a daily home schedule or timetable for your child so that there is time (1-2 hours)  allocated for outdoor activities.
 Spend time exploring and discovering the wonders of nature, e.g. bird watching,  picnic by the seaside, going on nature  walks, etc.
 There is currently no evidence that eye exercises help in preventing or slowing myopia progression"

This results in light rays from distant objects focusing in front of the retina instead of on the retina. Distant objects are thus seen to be blurred but near objects remain clear.
Presbyopia, also commonly known locally as 'Lao Hua, develops as we age due to the loss of elasticity and contracting ability of the focusing muscles and the lens in our eye. This reduces the ability to focus for near and commonly starts from the age of 40. Myopic patients above the age of 40 will have presbyopia as well.
Your optician will recommend the appropriate glasses prescription for you based on your visual needs. Options include separate pairs of glasses for distance and near, bifocals, progressive lenses.

It works by blocking the chemical acetylcholine, which relaxes the ciliary muscle of the eye and causes the pupils to dilate.
Atropine has also been found to be effective in inhibiting myopia progression in children by preventing excessive growth or elongation of the eyeball. It has been first prescribed for myopia in children since the 1960s. In the past, high dose atropine was used routinely, but since 2014, we have started using low dose atropine as our first line.

LASIK takes approximately 15 minutes to perform for each eye. It is done as a day surgery (outpatient) procedure without the need for hospital admission.
It is a two-step procedure which begins with a hinged flap creation using a mechanical microkeratome (a blade device) or a laser keratome (a laser device).

At the start of surgery, anaesthetic eye drops are applied. Once the eye is numbed, an eyelid speculum is inserted to prevent the eyelids from blinking. Next, a thin flap is created in the outer layer of the cornea, using either a specialised mechanical blade (microkeratome) or a femtosecond laser. A little pressure or tightness may be felt at this stage.
Next, the hinged corneal flap is lifted, exposing the treatment area. You will be prompted to look and focus on an overhead target light. Pulses from a computer-controlled laser vaporise a predetermined portion of the stroma and the flap is replaced. A loud noise and a slight smell may occur during the application.
Finally, the flap is repositioned upon completion and allowed to adhere, stitch-free. The eyelid speculum is removed at this stage."

During LASIK, the excimer laser thins the cornea in order to correct refractive errors like myopia and astigmatism. Hence, higher degrees of spectacle power correction result in proportionately thinner corneas. Rarely, thin and weakened corneas may progressively bulge forward, a condition called corneal ectasia. LASIK Xtra is postulated to reduce this risk by strengthening the cornea."

  utter_lasik_refractivesurgery-treatment_laser_surgery-cornearefractive_179:

LASIK Xtra involves the use of a chemical containing riboflavin (a type of vitamin) and Dextran. Immediately after LASIK, the riboflavin solution is applied to the cornea and ultraviolet light is applied to the cornea for about 45 seconds. The entire process only adds about two minutes to the LASIK procedure. There is no added discomfort during LASIK Xtra.
As a cornea-strengthening procedure, cross-linking has been widely performed for eyes with weaker corneal strength and also in eyes with corneal thinning after LASIK.
LASIK Xtra may be useful in normal eyes where the cornea may become very thin after LASIK. Therefore, it may benefit patients requiring high spectacle power correction and in patients with naturally thin corneas.
In general, visual outcomes are not affected by this additional procedure LASIK Xtra and the procedure may reduce the risk of corneal weakness after LASIK in certain individuals."

This procedure involves softening or loosening the outer surface layer of the cornea (epithelium) with diluted alcohol. The corneal epithelium is then easily removed. The excimer laser is then used to treat the surface of the cornea directly; the amount of treatment is dependent on the individuals refractive error.
At the end of the procedure, a soft bandage contact lens is applied to aid healing and improve comfort. The bandage lens may remain in place for up to a week depending on how quickly healing occurs.
Visual recovery is slightly slower than with LASIK and there may be pain or discomfort while the eye is healing (3-4 days). The vast majority of patients achieve results equivalent to LASIK in the long term."

  utter_lasik_refractivesurgery-treatment_laser_surgery-cornearefractive_181:

LASIK involves cutting a corneal flap (usually measuring 90-115 microns in thickness). In LASEK, on the other hand, only the epithelial or surface layer of the cornea (measuring about 50 microns in thickness) is removed.
The epithelium (surface layer) of the cornea is first loosened by the application of diluted alcohol for about 60 seconds before it is removed during the surgery in LASEK.
Hence, LASEK is more suitable for individuals who have thin corneas and who are otherwise unsuitable for LASIK."

  utter_lasik_refractivesurgery-treatment_laser_surgery-cornearefractive_182:
  - text: "There are some disadvantages of LASEK compared to LASIK.
Firstly, the visual recovery is slower in LASEK. Recovery to reasonably clear vision typically takes about three to five days in LASEK compared to about one day in LASIK. In LASEK, most patients may experience some eye painfor about one or two days after the surgery. This pain is usually relieved by taking analgesics (painkillers).
By wearing a soft bandage contact lens for a few days, the eye pain is also greatly reduced in most patients such that sometimes, oral analgesics are unnecessary. Because of the slower visual recovery process in LASEK, surgery on both eyes is usually done on different days. With LASIK, surgery on both eyes is performed routinely on the same day.
The long-term visual recovery process typically stabilises at about three to six months following surgery in LASEK as compared to one to two months in LASIK."

After LASEK surgery, you are required to apply the steroid eye drops for at least one month. This is in contrast to LASIK surgery where the antibiotic and steroid eye drops are applied only for one week following surgery.
Depending on the specific occupational requirements of the patient, he or she can usually return to work about five to seven days after undergoing LASEK surgery. This is slightly longer than in LASIK, where the patient may return to work after one or two days following surgery.
LASEK patients can resume their sports activities earlier than LASIK patients. As there is no corneal flap in LASEK, there is no danger of any flap complications that may arise due to accidental eye trauma.
LASEK patients may resume a wide range of sporting activities, including contact sports, once the epithelial layer of the cornea has fully healed and they are no longer wearing the bandage contact lens. This typically occurs after one week."

Small spots or floaters may also indicate blood vessel leaks and may clear up in days, weeks, or even months. In the most severe form, with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, there may be sudden severe vision loss from vitreous bleeding or tractional retinal detachment.

Because the disease is initially asymptomatic, and can be treated in the earlier stages, it is important to have an eye examination each year, and immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. Late diagnosis and treatment can result in irreversible vision loss."

Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy

Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, also known as background diabetic retinopathy, is the early stage of diabetic retinopathy and occurs when the small retinal blood vessels become affected and start to leak and bleed.
At this stage, vision is usually not affected.

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy

Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is associated with a high risk of permanent loss of vision.
There is growth of abnormal new blood vessels in the retina. These abnormal new vessels can rupture causing significant bleeding that will lead to loss of vision. Progressively, the scar tissues that form can cause retinal detachment.
The abnormal blood vessels can grow on the iris and block the outflow of fluid from the eye.
Neovascular glaucoma can ensue with risk of optic nerve damage and blindness.

Those who have poorly controlled diabetes are at higher risk of developing diabetic retinopathy earlier and at more severe stages.

People with diabetes should get a comprehensive dilated eye examination or screening at least once a year. If you have diabetic retinopathy, your ophthalmologist can recommend treatment to help prevent its progression."

Fragile, abnormal blood vessels can develop and leak blood into the centre of the eye, blurring vision.
Diabetic retinopathy can also cause macular oedema. The macula is the central part of the retina that allows for fine details to be seen in the centre of vision. When fluid from blood vessels leaks into the macula, it can swell and result in blurred vision."

You can also help slow down the development of diabetic retinopathy by keeping your blood glucose in check.

The HbA1c is a measure of blood sugar level over a three-month period and it should ideally be less than 7 per cent.

Other medical conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and heart disease should be treated and kept under control. Smoking should be stopped and you should exercise regularly. This will reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy"

Fundus photography can provide effective and efficient assessment of the diabetic retinopathy status in most patients, although those with media opacity like significant cataract may not be suitable.
The Singapore integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Programme (SiDRP) uses telemedicine to enable fundus photographs taken at the polyclinic and participating primary care facilities to be transmitted to the specialist eye care centres for interpretation and diagnosis. This provides a safe, reliable and quality-assured diabetic retinopathy screening programme for Singapore.
If there are any abnormalities in the photography or if the quality is insufficient for adequate assessment, you will be referred to your ophthalmologist for further assessment and management."

If you have macular oedema, severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or proliferative diabetic retinopathy, treatment is necessary. The aim of treatment is to prevent further damage to the retina and further vision loss.

A procedure called laser photocoagulation can be performed to seal or destroy growing or leaking blood vessels in the retina.
- Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP)
This is used to treat the peripheral retina to prevent or stop the growth of the abnormal new blood vessels.
- Focal laser
This is used to treat the macular oedema to reduce the swelling.

In general, each eye requires two to three sessions for a PRP to be completed. You will
be expected to go for regular treatments over a period of six to twelve months before diabetic retinopathy is controlled adequately.

In patients with loss of central vision due to diabetic macular oedema, intravitreal injections of medication into the centre of the eye can reduce the macular swelling and improve vision.
Medications which are injected into the eye for diabetic macular oedema include Anti Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) drugs such as Avastin, Lucentis and Eylea, as well as steroids.
Often, multiple injections at intervals of one month or longer are required to achieve resolution of the swelling. Repeated injections at longer intervals may also be required to maintain the visual improvement.

In some people with diabetic retinopathy, the abnormal blood vessels in the retina may also result in massive bleeding into the centre of the eye (vitreous humor), causing sudden severe loss of vision. A surgical procedure called a vitrectomy can be used to remove the blood that has leaked into this part of the eye."

Light rays that enter the eye are focused onto the retina, stimulating the nerve fibres which then send information to the brain to process what we see. If it is not treated early, retinal detachment may lead to permanent loss of vision which may be partial or even complete.

Retinal detachment occurs after a tear in the retina develops, allowing fluid to pass through it to separate the retina from the wall of the eye. Over time, the detachment may cause the retina to lose contact with the blood supply of the eye and stop functioning. This is when you lose your vision."

If you experience the symptoms of a retinal detachment, you should see an ophthalmologist immediately. If too much time lapses, the chances of successfully repairing the retina through surgery will be lower, and you may develop permanent vision loss.

The following tests, instruments and procedures may be needed to diagnose retinal detachment.

 Ophthalmoscope The ophthalmologist may use an instrument with a bright light and a special lens to examine the inside of your eye. The ophthalmoscope provides a highly detailed 3D view, allowing the ophthalmologist to see any retina holes, tears or detachments.
 Ultrasonography This test uses sound waves to create a picture on a video monitor. The sound waves travel through your eye and bounce off your retina and other structures within the eye create the image"

Retinal Tears
When a retinal tear or hole has not progressed to a retinal detachment, your ophthalmologist may suggest an outpatient procedure to seal the tear or hole to prevent retinal detachment.


- Laser surgery (photocoagulation) The ophthalmologist directs a laser beam at the retinal tear. The burns produced by the laser will adhere the retina to the underlying tissue.

- Freezing In this process, a freezing probe is applied to the outer surface of the eye directly over the retinal tear or hole to freeze the area around the hole. The scar that subsequently develops will help to secure the retina to the eye wall.

After the procedure, you may be advised to refrain from vigorous activity for one month to allow time for the bonds created by the procedure to strengthen.

Retinal Detachment
If your retina has detached, surgical procedures will be required to repair it. The specifics of your retinal detachment will determine which approach your ophthalmologist recommends.

- Scleral buckling Your ophthalmologist may choose to place a scleral buckle which is a silicon band that encircles the eye like a belt. The scleral buckle seals the retinal tears externally.

- Vitrectomy A vitrectomy involves removing the vitreous (the jelly-like substance in the eye cavity) and filling the eye with a gas bubble to hold the retina in place, giving it time to heal. After a vitrectomy, your ophthalmologist may ask you to maintain a certain head posture for a few weeks to position the gas bubble against the hole or tear in the retina. You will not be allowed to travel by plane until the gas bubble has been fully absorbed. Depending on the type of gas used, it might take within 1 week to 2 months before the gas is entirely absorbed.

With modern therapy, over 90 per cent of those with a retinal detachment can be successfully treated with one procedure, although sometimes a second operation may be required. The degree of vision that returns after successful surgery will vary depending on the extent and duration of the retinal detachment."

The innermost layer is the retina, which senses light and sends images to your brain. The outermost layer is the sclera, the strong white wall of the eye. The middle layer between the sclera and retina is called the uvea.
The uvea contains many blood vessels - the veins, arteries and capillaries - that carry blood flow to the eye. Because the uvea nourishes many important parts of the eye (such as the retina), inflammation of the uvea can result in poor vision. There are different types of uveitis, depending on the part of the eye which is affected
 When the uvea is inflamed near the front of the eye in the iris, it is called iritis or anterior uveitis. Iritis usually has a sudden onset and may last six to eight weeks; usually the eye is red and painful.
 If the uvea is inflamed in the middle of the eye, it is called intermediate uveitis. Patients frequently experience floaters and poor vision from retinal swelling.
 An inflammation in the back of the eye is called posterior uveitis, which includes retinitis, choroiditis and vasculitis, when it affects the retina, choroid layer, or retinal vessels respectively.
 An inflammation that involves the whole eye is called panuveitis. If this serious condition is untreated, it may result in poor vision from damage to your eye structure."

The condition can make it difficult to read, recognise faces or drive safely. Peripheral vision remains intact in most people and this will allow them to remain independent with most of the other daily activities. AMD is one of the leading causes of blindness affecting those 50 years or older.
AMD occurs in 'dry and 'wet forms. 90 per cent of AMD patients suffer from the 'dry form. Studies from the Singapore Eye Research Institute have shown that smokers are four times more likely to develop the 'wet or advanced form of AMD than non-smokers.
Dry AMD results in slow progressive loss of central vision. The condition develops as the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down with age. Wet AMD, also known as exudative or neovascular AMD, is caused by the growth of small, abnormal blood vessels under the retina in the macula.
Wet AMD usually arises from pre-existing dry AMD. What are the symptoms? These abnormal blood vessels leak blood, fluid, lipids and protein, resulting in disruption of the normal structure of the retina. If it is not treated, scar tissue form under the macula and central vision is permanently destroyed. The 'wet form commonly results in advance visual loss within a short period of time."

 Amsler Grid Your ophthalmologist may ask you to look at an Amsler grid. Changes in your central vision may cause the lines in the grid to disappear or appear wavy, a sign of AMD. This is also used to monitor patients at home for progression.
 Fundus Fluorescein Angiogram (FFA) and Indocyanine Green Angiogram (ICG) In this test, a fluorescent dye is injected into a vein in your arm. Pictures are taken as the dye passes through the blood vessels in your eye. This makes it possible to see leaking blood vessels, which occur in the 'wet type of AMD. In rare cases, complications due to the injection can arise, like nausea or more severe allergic reactions.
 Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) You have probably heard of ultrasound, which uses sound waves to capture images of living tissues. OCT is similar except that it uses light waves, and can achieve very high-resolution crosssectional images of any tissues that can be penetrated by light, such as the eyes. After your eyes are dilated, you will be asked to place your head on a chin rest and hold still for several seconds while the images are obtained. The light beam is painless.

Treatment can stabilise the vision, however, the degree of improvement will depend on how early the disease is detected and the response to the treatment.
Intravitreal injections (drugs injected into the eye)
Currently, the most common treatment is in the form of drugs injected into the eye. Avastin, Lucentis and Eylea are examples of anti-VEGF drugs used to treat wet AMD as they block the growth of abnormal blood vessels. The injection can be performed safely after the eye has been anaesthetised with eye drops. You will experience some mild discomfort after the injection.
Avastin is accepted by all public hospitals and institutions for treatment of AMD
However, the effect of each injection would usually last for one month and a long course of repeated injections is required to adequately control the condition. Clinical studies have suggested that at least 12 to 14 injections will be required over a two year period to control the disease. During this time, your eye condition should be reviewed frequently as response can vary between individuals. Your ophthalmologist will also need to repeat the OCT scan at most visits, and the angiogram periodically to assess your response.
Other treatment options (usually used in combination) In some selected cases, other forms of treatment, with or without injections may also be recommended by your ophthalmologist. Photodynamic therapy uses a non-thermal laser together with an intravenous drug (verteporfin) to reduce leakage and seal up abnormal blood vessels. Laser photocoagulation uses a hot laser to destroy the abnormal blood vessels. For dry AMD, there is currently no known treatment, but supplements may help slow down the progression in high-risk eyes. Early detection of conversion to the wet type is also important for better preservation of vision."

(A)   If there is significant macular swelling (oedema), your ophthalmologist may recommend you to undergo regular injections of medications such as anti-VEGF or steroids to reduce the swelling and improve your vision
(B)   If your FFA shows that there is significant lack of blood supply to the retina, your ophthalmologist may recommend you to undergo a laser treatment called panretinal photocoagulation. Similar to patients with diabetic retinopathy, this laser is performed so as to reduce the overall blood supply and oxygen needs of the cells in your retina so that your vision can be preserved. This is especially so when there are abnormal blood vessels growing which can lead to neovascular glaucoma."

Night blindness is a symptom that suggests an underlying problem, usually of the retina. Patients with night blindness can have poor eyesight and colour vision, reduced reaction time between light and dark places as well as tunnel vision. Driving at night can be very challenging as well and patients with night blindness are usually not fit to drive. In patients with diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, the condition is usually progressive and can lead to total blindness."

         Inherited retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and congenital stationary night blindness
         Cataracts
         Myopia (short-sightedness)
         Glaucoma
         Vitamin A deficiency
         Retinal laser for retinal diseases like diabetes
Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of genetic disorders that can be inherited. It results in progressive loss of cells in the retina that is required for vision. Individuals with retinitis pigmentosa can begin to show symptoms at varying ages. Classically, retinitis pigmentosa commonly results in symptoms of night blindness, poor vision and tunnel vision. It is usually progressive and can lead to total blindness."

  utter_nyctalopia-treatment_general-retina:
  - text: "Your ophthalmologist will perform a detailed examination to look for causes of night blindness such as cataracts and scarring of the retina. Tests such as the Humphrey Visual Field and electroretinogram to assess the function of the retina would be required to find the cause of your night blindness. If your ophthalmologist has determined that you have an inherited retinal disease, genetic tests can be used to locate the exact gene which could help determine the probability that your children might be affected by the same disease as well.
The treatment for night blindness generally depends on the exact cause. Cataracts can be treated with surgery to remove the cloudy lens while Vitamin A supplements will help the patients that suffer from Vitamin A deficiency. Glaucoma is an irreversible condition and main treatment would be eye pressure control.
There is currently no treatment for retinitis pigmentosa. Visual and navigation aids are available that can improve the quality of life. In addition, patients with retinitis pigmentosa should avoid dark areas or going out at night. Some surgeries such as retinal implants are at the experimental stage and not yet in widespread use. "

  - text: "Amblyopia, commonly known as lazy eye, is a condition where vision does not develop properly during early childhood. It can occur in one or both eyes. After the age of seven to eight years, the development of the part of the childs brain that processes vision is almost complete. If the brain has not received clear images from the weak eye prior to that, it would be difficult to improve vision in that eye after the visual part of the brain development is complete. The eye is then said to be 'amblyopic or 'lazy. If left untreated, visual impairment can become permanent. "

  utter_amblyopia-cause-paediatricophthalmology:
  - text: "The main causes of amblyopia are uncorrected high refractive error (astigmatism, hyperopia, myopia), large differences in refractive power between the two eyes, and/or squint (strabismus). A minority are due to conditions that obstruct vision, such as droopy eyelids and childhood cataracts which may be genetic conditions."

  utter_amblyopia-symptoms_signs-paediatricophthalmology:

In Singapore, our Health Promotion Board has a national vision screening programme for children starting from 4 years old that will be able to help detect if your child has amblyopia."

  utter_amblyopia-signs_doctorsexaminationfindings_investigations-paediatricophthalmology:

  utter_amblyopia-treatment_general-paediatricophthalmology:
  - text: "To correct amblyopia, the child needs to be encouraged to use the lazy eye. This is usually done by patching the good eye, often for several hours a day. Patching therapy may take months or even years, and is often more effective when it is started at a younger age. The basis of patching is to allow the lazy eye to be used more often than the other eye so that the lazy eye gets a chance to develop normal vision. If spectacles are required, the child must wear it at all times.
When amblyopia is detected too late (beyond 8 years old), it may not be possible to reverse the visual impairment. It is therefore important that you have your childs eyes checked if you suspect a visual problem, or are advised by the school health services to consult an ophthalmologist."

While one eye looks straight ahead, the squinting eye may turn inwards (convergent squint) or outwards (divergent squint). A squint can also be vertical with one eye higher than the other. This condition can happen at any age. Squints can be present all the time or be intermittent, occurring in certain situations, like when the child is reading, tired or looking in the distance. A squint can result in defective binocular or stereovision (3D vision). Children with squints can also develop lazy eye (medically termed 'amblyopia)."

It can also be caused by abnormally high spectacle power (e.g. hyperopia or long-sightedness), or anything that obscures the vision in one eye (e.g. childhood cataracts). Occasionally, it may be due to an abnormality of the nerves supporting the eye muscles, or an abnormality in the eye muscles or surrounding tissue within the eye socket."

In certain types of squints, the child may close one eye to obscure a double image, or tilt his/ her head to achieve better alignment. Many Asian children often appear to have a convergent squint as a result of a prominent skin fold that covers the inner part of the eye, causing the eyes to appear to turn inwards (towards the nasal bridge). This is a pseudo squint, and no treatment is necessary. Your childs paediatrician or doctor will often be able to tell you whether your child has a true or pseudo squint, and will refer him/ her to an ophthalmologist for further assessment and treatment."

Most of the time, the cause of the tearing is due to blockage of normal tear flow into the nose. It is generally mild and majority will resolve by the time your child is 1 year old. However, there is a risk of infection of the tear sac that is located between the eye and the nasal bridge. If that happens, your child will need antibiotic eyedrops and oral medications. In more severe cases, they will need to stay in the hospital and receive intra-venous antibiotics.
If your babys tearing is due to viral conjunctivitis, it will usually resolve within a few weeks. If the conjunctivitis develops within the 1st month of birth, it could be a viral or bacterial conjunctivitis and you need to bring your baby to the ophthalmologist as soon as possible for a proper evaluation.
In-turned eyelashes, foreign body or corneal abrasions will require medical attention and treatment to prevent permanent damage to the cornea.

  utter_tearing-treatment_general-paediatricophthalmology:
  - text: "The treatment for tearing in a child depends on the exact problem.
-	If your child has blockage of the tear drainage, massaging the inner corner of the eyelids over the site of the lacrimal sac may hasten the opening of the blockage. However, if the tearing persists despite the massage, flushing and probing of the drainage system can be done to perforate the membranous blockage. This procedure is usually performed when the child is less than one year old. The flushing and probing can be repeated if the tearing persists. Persistent tearing despite all these measures would require surgical procedures to relieve the obstruction.
-	If your child has mild in-turning of the lashes, treatment with lubricating eyedrops such as Optrex would usually suffice. In more serious cases, a small surgery would be required to turn the eyelashes out.
-	If your child has conjunctivitis or corneal abrasions, treatment with the appropriate eyedrops and antibiotics would be required.

It results in the abnormal and irregular growth of blood vessels in the retina of the eye. In the worst case scenario, these vessels can lead to scarring, bleeding, retinal detachment and blindness.
It is believed that abnormally high levels of oxygen in the blood may contribute to the development of retinopathy of prematurity. Your baby will be closely monitored by the neonatologist with blood tests and pulse oximeter to avoid excessive levels of oxygen."

Premature babies who receive high amounts of oxygen or suffer from conditions such as severe lung disease or bleeding in the brain are also at higher risk of developing retinopathy of prematurity.
Studies in Singapore have shown that about 30% of babies with birth weight less than 1250g or born before 32 weeks develop retinopathy. This risk is high enough to warrant screening of these babies at risk of retinopathy of prematurity."

If the condition unfortunately progresses and satisfies a set of strict criterias for treatment, your ophthalmologist will discuss and recommend the appropriate treatment for your baby. The most common option is laser performed under general anaesthesia which aims to apply tiny burns from the laser beam to destroy abnormal areas of the retina to stop the progression of the disease.

The better eye is patched so that the child will be forced to view with his amblyopic (lazy) eye. This provides better visual stimulus to the developing brain which helps to improve the clarity of the images. Sometimes, patching is also performed for children who have a squint. Patching will then be applied to the non-drifting eye, forcing him to focus and control the drifting eye. Do note that patching should be applied during the waking hours when the child is active for maximal effect.
Adhesive eye patches are recommended as they are able to completely cover your childs eye. If the child is wearing glasses, the glasses should be worn over the adhesive eye patch. Cloth patches that fit over the glasses are also available, but in order to work effectively, the glasses must be well fitted and the cloth has to cover the lens and the space between the glasses and the skin completely so that the child cannot peek around the patches"

  utter_nan-nan-paediatricophthalmology:
  - text: "Some children might naturally be resistant to patching. Due to this, the patches are usually specially designed with bright colours and attractive images so that the child can feel more comfortable with patching. In addition, try to make patching a consistent part of the daily routine as this will encourage the younger children to patch.
Adhesive patches can also lead to skin sensitivity. If that develops, you should try a different brand of adhesive patch. Applying lubrication on the childs skin would also help to reduce the sensitivity. Otherwise, switching to cloth patches might be useful.
Excessive patching can sometimes lead to poorer vision in the patched eye. Your ophthalmologist will assess your child and recommend the appropriate duration of patching for your child.
Lastly, there is a limit to the effectiveness of patching. Patching is most effective when they are started around the age of 4-5 years old. Once the child has reached visual maturity at age 7-8 years old, patching will no longer have a significant impact on the childs vision."

Others cannot distinguish certain colours in any light. The most severe form of colour blindness, in which everything is seen in shades of grey, is uncommon. Colour blindness usually affects both eyes equally and remains stable throughout life.

Congenital ptosis - Ptosis which is present at birth is called congenital ptosis. This is usually a result of improper development of the levator muscle which lifts the upper eyelid. Children with ptosis often tilt their heads or lift their eyebrows frequently to see properly.
Eye injury, trauma or disease - Sometimes, an eye trauma, injury or disease can cause ptosis. Generally, this occurs when there is either damage to the levator muscles that hold the eyelids up, or damage to the nerves which control these muscles. It is also not uncommon to develop ptosis after cataract surgery or after contact lens wear. Other causes of ptosis include third cranial nerve palsy and neurological muscular disorders such as myasthenia and muscle dystrophies.

Depending on how severely the lid droops, people with ptosis may have difficulty keeping their eyes open, may feel eye strain and eyebrow ache from the increased effort to raise the lids, or fatigue when reading. At its most severe, ptosis can obstruct ones vision as the upper eyelid sags so much that it begins to cover the pupil. Many people with severe ptosis find themselves tilting their heads backwards to see from under the eyelid. Ptosis generally gives the face a tired or severe appearance. Depending on the underlying cause, ptosis can occur suddenly or worsen gradually."

  utter_ptosis-treatment_general-oculoplastic:

The surgery is performed by an ophthalmologist on an outpatient basis, usually under a local anaesthetic. The main goal of surgery is to elevate the upper eyelid to permit better vision, and attempt to achieve a reasonable amount of symmetry. Good to excellent results can be achieved although perfect symmetry may not always be obtained. For congenital ptosis, it is not always possible to achieve complete symmetry of both lid positions and function after surgery due to the abnormal function. Hence, patients may still have a drooping lid on up-gaze and the white of the eye (sclera) will become visible on downgaze. There may also be inadequate lid closure during sleep. Congenital ptosis is usually repaired in childhood if it is severe and obstructs vision. If mild, it can be repaired either in later childhood or early adulthood. Ptosis in both children and adults can be treated with surgery to improve vision as well as cosmetic appearance. It is very important that children with ptosis have regular ophthalmic examinations early in life to protect them from the serious consequences of untreated amblyopia."

	Over or undercorrection of the eyelid position
	Difficulty in closing the eyes
	Infection
	Bleeding
	Wound gape
	If the surgery is only performed on one eye, the other eye might droop after the surgery
	Asymmetrical contour between the two eyes
	Scarring
If you are on blood thinners, you might be required to stop the medications a few days before the operation so that the risk of bleeding during and after the surgery can be reduced. Occasionally, your surgeon might need to perform readjustment in the procedure room after the surgery to achieve the optimal outcome.
Usually, these complications will go away within weeks. However, occasionally these complications may be permanent and further surgical procedures may be necessary to correct them.

Occasionally, entropion is due to scarring of the inner surface of the eyelid, caused by inflammation, chronic infections or trauma. These conditions usually distort the normal curve of the eyelid and cause your eyelid to turn in."

It is thus important to have this condition repaired before these complications permanently damage the eye. If entropion is present in an eye requiring cataract removal, it is advisable to correct the lid abnormality first, before cataract surgery."

  utter_entropion-treatment_general-oculoplastic:
  - text: "Surgery is usually required to tighten the lower eyelid and its attachments which will restore some of its elasticity and to reposition it. If you need to delay surgery, tape or sutures can be used to temporarily reposition the eyelid and protect the eye. However, these measures do not result in permanent cure. Entropion causes irritation which in severe cases may lead to permanent blurring of vision. It should be treated by ophthalmic surgeons who are trained to manage this condition."

	Over or undercorrection
	Failure with recurrence of the entropion
	Infection
	Bleeding
	Wound gape
	Scarring
If you are on blood thinners, you might be required to stop the medications a few days before the operation so that the risk of bleeding during and after the surgery can be reduced.
Usually, these complications will go away within weeks. However, occasionally these complications may be permanent and further surgical procedures may be necessary to correct them."

  utter_eyebags-condition-oculoplastic:
  - text: "The eyes are often the first features that draw attention and therefore form an important aspect of facial attractiveness and beauty. Over time, ageing can cause the upper and lower eyelids to appear droopy or become baggy. Sagging skin, the weakening of facial muscles and build-up of fat pockets around the eyes can give rise to unsightly eye bags or rings. At the same time, age and gravity can cause the eyebrow area to sag or droop. Apart from aesthetics, such conditions may also impair vision and cause eye strain or fatigue."

  utter_eyebags-treatment_surgical-oculoplastic:
  - text: "Blepharoplasty is a form of aesthetic eyelid surgery that corrects the baggy or sagging tissues around the eyes through the removal of excess skin, fat and muscle from the eyelids. It is considered to be a reconstructive surgery that is done to improve your vision, your appearance, or both. After the surgery, it will usually produce an effect that is pleasing to look at and can give you a more youthful, rested look. Sometimes when a person has eyelid surgery, it can be performed on one or both eyelids."

  utter_eyebags-treatment_surgical-oculoplastic_15:
  - text: "Blepharoplasty is performed under local anaesthesia. Incisions are made along the natural folds of the eyelid skin so that they are virtually unnoticeable when they heal. These incisions are closed with fine stitches. If the eyebrows are also droopy, a procedure called brow lift can also be performed. There is only a mild discomfort after surgery. You may expect some swelling, bruising and tightness of the eyelids but these will resolve once the wounds heal. Infrequently, slight asymmetry in the eyelid appearance or position might occur, and may require additional surgery to correct it. Cosmetic eyelid surgery should always be performed by qualified surgeons who are appropriately trained as incorrect surgery may lead to complications."

 You will stay in the recovery room for one or two hours after surgery and will be discharged once you are no longer drowsy from the anaesthesia and the risk of abnormal bleeding, nausea, or swelling has passed.
 Cold compresses will help reduce swelling and bruising.
 Pain medication will be prescribed for you, if needed.
 Avoid contact sports for three to four weeks.
 Avoid activities that can increase your pulse or blood pressure for two or three days to lower your risk of bleeding and swelling."

  utter_nasolacrimalductblockage-condition-oculoplastic:
  - text: "Tears are produced constantly by the lacrimal gland which is located under the upper eyelid. Tears are essential because they form a thin film that coats the front surface of the eye and prevents it from becoming dry. Normally, tears are quickly drained from the eye through a system of channels that lead from the inner corner of the eyelids into the nose. This system of channels is called the lacrimal drainage system. Tearing disorders may be due to irritation of the eye or disorder of the drainage system. This can be determined by paying a visit to an ophthalmologist who will perform simple tests to determine the cause."

This is done in the clinic by flushing the tear ducts with saline. Flushing the system might relieve the symptoms temporarily, but they often recur after sometime. Surgery is necessary to treat those with severe obstruction of the tear ducts, or those who have repeated infections of the system. The operation required is called dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), in which a new channel is created to allow tears to drain into the nose again. Specific operations depend on the site of obstruction."

	Failure with persistent tearing
	Infection
	Cerebrospinal fluid leak from the nose
	Tube related risks (such as dislodgement, infection, loss of the tubing)
	Scarring
	Need for repeat surgery"

  utter_nasolacrimalductblockage-treatment_surgical-oculoplastic_23:

This helps to keep the passage open and increase the success rate of the surgery. The silicone stents are usually removed between 3 to 6 months after surgery. Your ophthalmologist will check to ensure the passage way is open before removing the stent. In the meantime, you might experience some tearing as the stent is still inside the tear duct."

  utter_nasolacrimalductblockage-postoperative-oculoplastic:

	Putting ice cubes in your mouth, avoid hot drinks or food
	Avoid straining, sneezing or coughing
	Sit up
If you are still unable to stop the bleeding, you should go to the Emergency clinic for a review by the ophthalmologist."

Patients with excessive thyroid hormone in the circulation (hyperthyroidism) can develop eye diseases and they may have any of the following symptoms
 Neck swelling from an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre)
 Intolerance to heat
 Sweatiness
 Increase in appetite and loss of weight
 Tremors
 Palpitations
 Tiredness
 Anxiety, nervousness and bad temper The most significant, but rare, complication of thyroid disease is loss of vision due to compression of the optic nerve by swollen tissues around the eye.
Swelling of the orbital tissues can cause the eyes to bulge outwards and limit the eyes ability to close the eyelids, exposing the front surface of the eye and causing irritation and damage to the cornea. Patients can also suffer from double vision due to marked swelling and stiffening of eye muscles."

Although the exact cause is unclear, what is known is that the body produces antibodies against its own tissues in the orbit. This sets off a series of biochemical events that lead to swelling of the orbital soft tissues, specifically the eye muscles and orbital fat. Patients who smoke have a significantly higher risk to develop severe thyroid eye disease. It is important to stop smoking to avoid aggravation of the thyroid eye disease."

  utter_thyroideyedisease-treatment_general-oculoplastic:
  - text: "It is common for thyroid eye disease to fluctuate within the first one to two years of the disease. Beyond this time, the disease tends to stabilise. Medical therapy (immunosuppression and radiotherapy) are more effective in the active phase of the disease whereas surgical treatment is usually reserved for patients in the inactive phase. It is important for you to be seen and treated by a physician for the underlying thyroid disease throughout this period. Smoking is known to aggravate the disease and should be avoided. Although thyroid eye disease tends to improve with good thyroid hormone control, this is not always the case, and consultation with an ophthalmologist is necessary.
Local Therapy - Tear substitutes and lubricants help to protect the surface of the eye from drying. Taping your eyelids closed at night is also helpful. Sleeping on extra pillows helps to reduce swelling around the eyes. Double vision can be troublesome if it affects straightforward and down-looking positions (as in reading). Special lenses called prisms may relieve this.
 Immunosuppression - Your physician will advise you on a suitable treatment for thyroid disease. Steroids are used in selected cases. The effect of steroids is temporary and once it is stopped, symptoms often rebound. Steroids cause many undesirable side effects when used over a long period of time. While you are on steroid treatment, your physician will monitor you for side effects which include obesity, gastric symptoms and bleeding, aggravation of diabetes and high blood pressure and decreased resistance to infection.
Radiation - Radiation is an effective way of reducing swelling of tissue around the eye and relieving compression of the optic nerve. The therapeutic dose used is low and it is usually not associated with significant adverse effects.
Surgery - When vision is threatened, early lid or orbital surgery may be necessary. Otherwise, surgery is usually reserved for stable, inactive disease with the following complications
 Abnormal staring appearance
 Severe protrusion of the eyes
 Disturbing double vision not relieved by prism glasses
 Drooping or sagging of tissues around the eyes
Thyroid eye disease should be treated by ophthalmic surgeons who specialise in conditions affecting the eyelids and socket."

Protrusion of the eye - protrusion of the eye prevents adequate closure by the eyelids. Conditions such as thyroid eye disease, infections or tumours growing behind the eye can end up pushing the eye forward
Muscle weakness - the nerve which controls the muscles of the eyelid and the face, also known as the facial nerve, can be affected. The most common cause is known as Bells palsy which typically develops suddenly. The exact mechanism is unknown but it is believed to be a result of a viral infection. Other conditions include muscle diseases, stroke as well as tumour growth damages the nerve.
Scarring - scarring can occur due to severe inflammation of the skin, trauma, burns or chemical injury. When there is excessive scarring, the eyelids become very tight and rigid which prevents normal movement to close the eye"

It is most commonly treated with eyedrops and ointment to keep the eye moist when the condition is mild. Taping of the eyelid at night or the use of moisture goggles can help. In more severe cases, a procedure called lateral tarsorrhaphy, where the upper and lower eyelids are swen together to narrow the eyelid opening, might be required to close the eye completely."

  utter_diplopia-cause-neuroophthalmology:
  - text: "Double vision, also called diplopia, is a symptom whereby a patient sees two images of a single object. It can be either monocular diplopia where the problem affects one eye only, or binocular diplopia where the problem comes from misalignment of both eyes.
In monocular diplopia, the double vision affects one eye and is present even when the other unaffected eye is covered. Monocular diplopia can be caused by uncorrected refractive errors, corneal disorders, cataracts and retinal disorders.
Binocular diplopia arises as a result of misalignment of the two eyes. The double image is only present when both eyes are open and disappears when either eye is covered. Based on the kind of misalignment the double vision can be horizontal, vertical or oblique. Binocular double vision can be caused by disorders affecting the nerves, eye muscles, nerve-muscle junction or socket bones of the eye.
If experiencing double vision, it is important to check if the double vision is monocular or binocular by covering each eye in turn. This will help your doctor distinguish the likely cause of the double vision.

MRI on the other hand is slower and more expensive but does not involve radiation. MRI scan produces images with very high resolution and it is the preferred imaging for small soft tissue abnormalities. However, due to its confined space and long image acquisition time, some patients might experience claustrophobia. In addition, if you have a metal implant, you will need to tell your doctor as you might not be suitable to undergo MRI scanning.
Both scans can be performed with or without contrast injection."

Antibodies are produced that act against your muscles signalling channels, resulting in weakness and fatigue of your muscles. It most commonly affects the muscles that control your eye movement and eyelid as well as large muscles such as your neck muscles, biceps and thigh muscles. If it only affects the eye, it is called Ocular Myasthenia Gravis (OMG). When it also affects other muscles in the body, it is called Generalised Myasthenia Gravis (GMG).
The specific cause of myasthenia gravis is currently unknown. It is sometimes associated with a tumour of the thymus gland which is located within your chest. Myasthenia gravis might also be associated with other immune system conditions such as thyroid eye disease. Myasthenia can be triggered by infections, stress, surgery or adverse reaction to certain medications. However, most patients with myasthenia gravis do not have an obvious cause. Inherited myasthenia is very rare and usually presents in infants."

OMG  Patients with OMG mainly experience droopy eyelids (ptosis) and double vision (diplopia). It is usually better in the morning and worsens towards the end of the day or when they are tired. Severe fatigue can cause the eyelid to obstruct the vision. The symptoms of OMG are very variable which is unlike a stroke which is usually sudden and persistent.
GMG  When GMG develops, patients can experience increasing weakness and fatiguability of the main muscles of the body. They might have difficulty keep their head up or neck straight, difficulty combing their hair or climbing stairs. In more severe cases, it can lead to difficulty swallowing, breathing or talking. In its most severe form called myasthenic crisis, it causes severe muscle weakness that leads to breathing failure. Intubation and mechanical ventilation will be required in such a scenario."

Your ophthalmologist will check for features of fatigubility as well as take measurements of the movements of your eyes and your eyelid position. An ice pack test, where a pack of ice is placed over your eyes for 2 minutes, can be performed in the clinic to look for improvement of the droopy eyelids. A significant improvement of at least 2mm is indicates that you are likely to have myasthenia gravis. Other diagnostic tests will include blood tests to look for the abnormal antibodies as well as electrical muscle tests to assess the strength of the muscle. A CT scan of the thorax might be required as well to look for thymus tumour"

Ocular myasthenia gravis  Treatment of OMG is dependent on the symptoms that you are experiencing. In most cases, an oral medication called Pyridostigmine is the preferred medication. It helps to improve muscle function by preventing the breakdown of the signalling pathway chemical called acetylcholine. If it is still insufficient, oral steroids or immune suppression medications might be required. Prisms stuck on or ground into the spectacle lenses are helpful to reduce double vision as well. Monitoring without active treatment can be considered for mild cases that do not have any troubling symptoms. Your ophthalmologist will assess and recommend the appropriate treatment for you.
Generalised myasthenia gravis  Treatment of GMG also depends on the severity of the condition. The main treatment for GMG are Pyridostigmine, steroids and immunosuppressants. In severe cases such as myasthenic crisis, intravenous immunoglobulins or blood plasmapheresis combined with intubation might be required. Patients found to have a thymoma (tumour of the thymus gland) on CT scan would require surgical removal as well."

If you have monocular double vision (double vision that persists when you close one eye) from astigmatism, you would need to update your glasses or contact lenses. Other less common causes such as dislocated lens or corneal scarring will need more specific treatments such as surgery.
If you have binocular double vision (double vision that is only perceived with both eyes open), you will need to be assessed for the underlying cause. You would be required to undergo some tests such as thyroid function test and CT or MRI scan. Options to reduce double vision include
a)      Fresnel prisms  cut out plastic prisms that can be stuck onto your spectacle lenses
b)      Ground in prisms  prisms incorporated into your lenses
         Prisms can cause aberration of the light rays which can lead to blurry or distorted images. Overly high prism powers are hence not advisable
c)       Occlusion therapy  Bangerter foils cut outs, which are near opaque, can be stuck on your spectacle lenses of the drifting eye. This blocks out the second image and removes the perception of double vision
d)      Squint surgery  Squint surgery can be performed on certain patients where the eye muscles that control the eye movement are strengthened or weakened. By re-balancing the eye muscles, it allows the drifting eye to be straightened once again, thereby bringing the two images close together till they are fused as one. "

The exact cause of blepharospasm is unknown but it is thought to be associated with an abnormal function in the basal ganglia of the brain.
In comparison, hemifacial spasm, another condition that results in involuntary twitch or spasm of the muscles of the face, only affects one half of the face.

During clinical examination, your ophthalmologist will perform a detailed assessment which includes your pupil reaction to light, visual field, colour vision and appearance of your optic disc. Presence of poor pupil response, swollen optic disc, poor colour vision as well as scotomas are highly suggestive of optic neuritis."

Blood tests will provide information regarding any inflammatory as well as infective conditions while an MRI scan will be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of optic neuritis. In patients with severe optic neuritis or urinary and bowel incontinence, a full spine MRI scan might be required as well. Sometimes, a procedure called lumbar puncture, where a small needle is inserted into the lower spine under anaesthesia, is required to collect a sample of the cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid, which is found in the brain and spinal cord, will be put through further tests to identify the cause.
Clinical tests such as the Humphrey or Goldmann Visual Field as well as Optical Coherence Tomography scan of the optic nerve are useful in assessing the degree of damage and track your recovery."

In some cases, treatment with steroids injected intravenously is needed to treat and speed up the recovery process. However, steroids might not make a difference in the final vision for typical optic neuritis.
More severe cases of optic neuritis (atypical optic neuritis) might require long term oral steroids or immunosuppressive medications. If the optic neuritis is caused by an infection, your ophthalmologist will recommend the appropriate treatment required to treat your condition.
If you have optic neuriti and your MRI brain scan shows characteristic whitish patches, you might be at higher risk of developing a condition called multiple sclerosis.

  - text: "Treatment of cranial 6th nerve palsy involves treating the cause and reducing the double vision. Your ophthalmologist might refer you to the otolaryngologist to check for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A lumbar puncture, where a needle is introduced into the lower spine to extract some spinal fluid, might be needed to assess the pressure within the brain and look for a cause. If the cause is due to a stroke, it should develop suddenly and stabilise. In such a scenario, you should experience some recovery after 1-2 months.
You would be required to undergo some tests such as thyroid function test and CT or MRI scan. Options to reduce double vision include
a)      Fresnel prisms  cut out plastic prisms that can be stuck onto your spectacle lenses
b)      Ground in prisms  prisms incorporated into your lenses
         Prisms can cause aberration of the light rays which can lead to blurry or distorted images. Overly high prism powers are hence not advisable
c)       Occlusion therapy  Bangerter foils cut outs, which are near opaque, can be stuck on your spectacle lenses of the drifting eye. This blocks out the second image and removes the perception of double vision
d)      Squint surgery  Squint surgery can be performed on certain patients where the eye muscles that control the eye movement are strengthened or weakened. By re-balancing the eye muscles, it allows the drifting eye to be straightened once again, thereby bringing the two images close together till they are fused as one."

  utter_thirdnervepalsy-condition-neuroophthalmology:
  - text: "The 3rd cranial nerve is the nerve that supplies most of the muscles of the eye. The muscles that the 3rd cranial nerve, also called oculomotor nerve, supply are responsible for pulling the eye upwards, downwards and inwards. It also supplies the muscle responsible for pulling up the upper eyelid. When it is affected, the eye will turn out and downwards as a result and the eyelid might droop down. When the nerve is being compressed by a tumour, it can lead to unequal pupils as well.
It results in horizontal and vertical binocular diplopia (double vision with the images horizontally and vertically side by side when both eyes are open) and droopy eyelid. Other conditions with potentially similar symptoms as 6th cranial nerve weakness include myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease, and tumour within the eye socket."

	Increased pressure in the brain
Other conditions with potentially similar symptoms as 3rd cranial nerve weakness include myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease or tumour within the eye socket. When the pupil is involved, it is likely to be due to tumour or aneurysm.

You would be required to undergo urgent tests such as a CT or MRI angiography scan. An angiography scan is necessary as it is specially designed to focus on the blood vessels to look for aneurysms. If an aneurysm is found, your ophthalmologist will refer you to the radiologist or neurosurgeons for the treatment of the aneurysm.

If this happens, you should consult an eye doctor for an evaluation immediately.
Other causes of central vision loss include cataracts, macular degeneration and holes as well as complications from conditions such as multiple sclerosis. In some cases, central vision loss can be the result of brain tumours or aneurysm. This type of vision loss involves loss of sight in the central area of the visual field and may affect one or both eyes depending on the contributing cause.

People who are unwell (with cold or flu) may also have more eye discharge. Pollen, gusty winds, dry eyes or an eyelash can cause an irritation which may also lead to the discharge.
More serious causes of eye discharge may be infectious conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers. Both of these conditions can lead to further complications, so if you are experiencing pain, eye swelling or visual changes in addition to eye discharge, you should consult your eye doctor immediately.

  utter_photopsia-symptoms_signs-miscellaneous:
  - text: "Eye flashes are experienced in the form of lighting streaks or flashing lights. Like floaters, eye flashes are eye symptoms that are commonly associated with vitreous detachment and, more seriously, with retinal detachment. They can also be triggered by a disease, head trauma or exposure to chemicals. In most cases, eye flashes are benign and are no cause for concern.
Ageing is the main cause of vitreous detachment. As one reaches middle age, the vitreous gel in the eye starts thickening and forms clumps inside the eye. This may be followed by shrinkage of the vitreous gel which may tug on the eye blood vessels causing the flashes. Rarely, this is associated with a retinal tear which may progress to a potentially blinding retina detachment.

	Stye (hordeolum) / inflammation of the upper and lower lids
	Conjunctivitis (pink eye)
	Contact lens complications
	Corneal problems (infection or injury such as a corneal abrasion)
	Sudden glaucoma
	Uveitis (inflammation inside the eye)
	Migraine headaches
	Sinus problems
	Viral infections such as the flu"

  utter_redeye-symptoms_signs-miscellaneous:
  - text: "Eye redness may be due to swollen or dilated blood vessels, which cause the surface of the eye to look red. This happens when the vessels in the surface of the white portion of the eye (sclera) become enlarged and irritated. This may result from extremely dry air, sun exposure, dust, foreign body, an allergic reaction, infection, trauma, or other conditions.
Eye infections are conditions caused by microbiological agents such as viruses and bacteria that may cause your eyes to become red and swollen. Conjunctivitis (pink eye) is the most common eye infection. It is an inflammation of the conjunctiva and the inner surface of the eyelids, usually due to a viral or bacterial infection. Sometimes, it can also be due to underlying allergic condition.
The other common kind of redness may be due to subconjunctival haemorrhage, or bloodshot eyes. This is due to a broken vessel in the eye, which appears very red over the underlying white portion of the eye (sclera). Bloodshot eyes may be accompanied by discomfort or tearing but is usually painless. It may be due to trauma or can occur spontaneously when the fine capillaries of the eye burst from sneezing, straining, vomiting or heavy lifting.
They usually will heal without treatment after a few days to one week. You should consult a doctor should your red eye be associated with pain, blurring of vision, persistent un-resolving red eye or trauma."

Itchy or flaky lids are irritating, but rarely serious. It is possible to reduce this irritation by keeping your eyelid clean and using artificial tears. If you have blepharitis that does not respond to regular cleaning, you may need to see an eye doctor for further course of treatment, as these may be symptoms of other underlying skin conditions such as rosacea, or Dermodex (eyelash mite) infestation.   "

  utter_floaters_flashes-symptoms_signs-miscellaneous:
  - text: "The dark, distinct spots you sometimes see in your field of vision are called floaters. Floaters occur when small clumps of the vitreous (a gel-like fluid) inside the eye detach from the inner wall of the eye as we age, otherwise known as posterior vitreous detachment. This is a common benign degeneration that occurs when our vitreous gel starts to dissolve and liquefy with age, resulting in a fluid and clumps of undissolved gel floating in the centre of the eye, hence we see a clump of floater in the vision.
Flashes are an illusion of flashing lights or lightning streaks that occur when the vitreous gel inside your eye rubs or pulls on the retina. They can be a small flash in just one spot, or it can be several flashes across a wider area of vision.
Seeing floaters and flashes are common and mostly benign, but it can be an indication of a more serious problem like retinal tear and retinal detachment. Eye injuries or excessive rubbing of the eyes can result in floaters as well. If you see a sudden onset of floaters, especially accompanied with flashing lights or blurring of vision, please consult your eye doctor for early diagnosis and treatment."

  utter_floaters_flashes-treatment_general-miscellaneous:
  - text: "There is no known prevention for floaters and flashes which are usually quite harmless. Flashes usually diminish with time another the floaters may remain. It is important to maintain good eye health and have your eyes checked regularly. In general, flashes and floaters rarely lead to any serious complications and hence no treatment is required. The effect of floaters can be minimised by wearing dark glasses when you are out in the bright sunlight or when you are looking at a brightly lit surface. Flashes usually disappear with time.
However, if you experience a sudden episode of floaters and flashes, particularly if this is followed by a dark shadow blocking a corner of your vision,you should consult your ophthalmologist immediately. Timely treatment with a laser or, in severe cases, surgery can help to prevent severe vision loss."

  utter_foreignbodysensation-symptoms_signs-miscellaneous:
  - text: "Any material such as dust, sand or paint that gets into the eye is called a foreign body. Foreign bodies fall into two categories
	Superficial foreign bodies these stick to the front of the eye or get trapped under one of the eyelids, but do not enter the eye.
	Penetrating foreign bodies these penetrate the outer layer of the eye (cornea or sclera) and enter the eye. These objects are usually travelling at high speed and are commonly made of metal.
Superficial foreign bodies are not usually serious, but may cause discomfort, red eyes and gritty sensation. If the superficial foreign body is stuck underneath the eyelid there may be pain with each blink.
A penetrating eye injury can be extremely serious as it may lead to blindness if not detected and treated promptly. Please seek consult with an eye doctor immediately should you have a foreign body enter your eye while perform high velocity activities such as grinding or hammering metal, especially when associate with pain or blurring of vision.
If you get a superficial foreign body in your eye, first-aid treatment such as gentle rinsing with warm water is appropriate. An 'eye bath' can make this easier to do on your own, or you can get someone to help rinse the eye from the side, with you lying down.
Do not try to remove a foreign body with cotton buds or any other type of solid object. It is advisable to consult a doctor if you think you have a foreign body in your eye and it continues to cause irritation."

  utter_halos-symptoms_signs-miscellaneous:
  - text: "Seeing haloes around lights is a symptom where coloured or luminous rings are seen around lights such as street lights or other light sources.
Haloes around bright lights tend to be especially worse when driving at night and can interfere with vision and are hence, potentially dangerous. They are commonly associated with glare, a symptom characterised by difficulty looking at bright light as it hurts the eyes, resulting in blurring of vision and tearing.
These symptoms are more common in older people, and in those who have had certain types of refractive surgery, certain types of cataracts or had multifocal lenses implanted after cataract surgery. Haloes can also occur in people with dry eyes or people whose pupils are widely dilated (for example, those who have been given eye drops for an eye examination)."

  utter_tunnelvision-symptoms_signs-miscellaneous:
  - text: "If your central vision is fine, but the areas outside your central field of vision start to lose clarity or detail, you may be losing your peripheral vision.
Peripheral vision allows you to see objects all around you without turning your head, and is responsible for detecting motion at the edges of our field of view to sense incoming danger. The remaining central field of vision makes it seem as though you are looking through a tunnel, hence the term 'tunnel vision. The loss of peripheral vision is not only debilitating - it also poses a major safety hazard.
One key cause of loss of peripheral vision is glaucoma, where the build-up of fluid and pressure within your eye damages the delicate fibres of the optic nerve. These delicate nerve fibres are responsible for carrying visual impulses from your eye to the brain. The damage is irreversible and can lead to blindness in advanced cases. However, early diagnosis and treatment can prevent vision loss from glaucoma.
If you are experiencing symptoms of tunnel vision, you should see your ophthalmologist as soon as possible. You might need to undergo specialised tests to determine whether you are really suffering from tunnel vision"
